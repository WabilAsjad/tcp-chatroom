# tcp-chatroom
* Author: Wabil Asjad 
* VERSION: v1.0 November 17, 2020

TCP-chatroom is a client - server program that creates a multithreaded chatroom. 

## Installation

Either use git clone, or download the files as a zip. 

## Usage

* ```cd``` to wherever this local repository is.
Open up at least two terminals, one for the server and another for a client. You can have multiple clients if preferred.

*```python3 server.py``` in one terminal window.
*```python3 client.py``` in another window.
Follow prompts as given.


## Limitations and Improvements
Currently this just sets up the connection for the clients and server. After this I'm going to add a "physical" chat room where clients can talk, as well as set up a database of approved clients.
